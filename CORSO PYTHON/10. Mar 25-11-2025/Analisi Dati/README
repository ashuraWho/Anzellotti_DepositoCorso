# --- DATA ANALYSIS SYSTEM ---

Aside from the comments, the entire program and README are written in English.
This is to accommodate people from other countries who use the system.

## Overview

This project is an interactive data analysis system written entirely in Python.
It allows you to:
- load TXT/CSV files containing 1D or 2D numerical data
- perform 1D analysis (basic statistics, positional stats...)
- perform 2D analysis (row/column statistics, matrix operations...)
- run a full analysis (1D + 2D)
- save analysis results to a text file (TXT/CSV)
- display information about the loaded data

## Main Features

### (1) File Loading

- Supports TXT and CSV
- Automatic shape detection
- Converts all inputs into a np.ndarray

### (2) 1D Analysis

Includes:
- minimum and maximum
- mean and std (standard deviation)
- median
- index of minimum and maximum values

### (3) 2D Analysis

Includes:
- row and column statistics (min, max, mean, sum)
- matrix operations:
	- determinant (square matrices)
	- covariance matrix
	- matrix–matrix product (when valid)
	- automatic shape validation

### (4) Full Analysis

Runs 1D + 2D analysis automatically (if applicable).

### (5) Result Saving

Results are saved in a TXT/CSV file.

### (6) Interactive Menu

(1) Upload file (TXT/CSV)
(2) Full analysis (1D + 2D)
(3) 1D analysis only
(4) 2D analysis only
(5) Save results
(6) Data information
(0) Exit

## How to Run the Program

- Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
- Make sure you have NumPy installed -> Install NumPy: pip install numpy
- Clone the repository: https://github.com/ashuraWho/Anzellotti_DepositoCorso/tree/main/CORSO%20PYTHON/10.%20Mar%2025-11-2025/Analisi%20Dati
- Run the program: python3 main.py

## Supported File Formats

- 1D example -> single row or column:
    1.2 3.4 5.6 7.8

- 2D example -> matrix:
    1, 2, 3
    4, 5, 6
    7, 8, 9

Supported separators:
- spaces
- commas

## Notes

- If 2D analysis is not possible (1D data), the program shows a warning but still performs the 1D analysis.
- If no TXT/CSV files are found in the current directory then the program creates them randomly: 'example.csv' and 'example.txt'.
